# Team Member Images

This folder is for storing team member profile photos.

## How to Use:

1. **Add your team member photos here** (e.g., `john-smith.jpg`, `sarah-johnson.jpg`)
2. **Recommended format**: JPG or PNG
3. **Recommended size**: 300x300 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
4. **File naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `john-smith.jpg`, `sarah-johnson.jpg`)

## Example Usage in Code:

```jsx
// In your team component
<img 
  src="/assets/images/team/john-smith.jpg" 
  alt="John Smith - Lead Developer"
  style={{
    width: '120px',
    height: '120px',
    borderRadius: '50%',
    objectFit: 'cover'
  }}
/>
```

## Current Team Members:

- **Jack** - Lead Developer (Mr.Jack.jpg)
- **Huy** - UI/UX Designer (Mr.Huy.JPEG)
- **Mike Chen** - Project Manager (emoji placeholder)

## Notes:

- Images will be automatically optimized by the build process
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB recommended)
- Use professional headshots for best results
- Ensure you have permission to use the photos
